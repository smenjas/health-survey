# Health Survey

This app allows you to take the [36-Item Short Form Survey Instrument (SF-36) from RAND Health
Care](https://www.rand.org/health-care/surveys_tools/mos/36-item-short-form/survey-instrument.html)
and tallies the results using their [scoring
instructions](https://www.rand.org/health-care/surveys_tools/mos/36-item-short-form/scoring.html).

## Privacy

[This app](https://smenjas.github.io/health-survey/) does not collect your
answers. Results are private. Neither the developers nor the hosting provider
can see your input. The "Clear Answers" button immediately deletes all data
from the browser.

```sh
npm install
```
